# Promise Handle ðŸ¤Œ

The `PromiseHandle` exported from this package extends the `Promise` class to expose the `resolve` and `reject` functions passed through the constructor as member functions.

Here's a few examples on how to use the `promise-handle` package.

  emitter.on("even", (event) => {
    resolve(event);

## But why? ðŸ¤·

I've written and added this small utility class into five code-bases already and I thought I might as well get it into the NPM registry to get it handy next time around.
